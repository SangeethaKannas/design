### Rules of Clean Design

"Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated" - Confucious

1. Simple Typefaces - Using simple and minimal fonts will make texts and whole design readable
  - Product Sans, SF Pro display, Poppins  
2. Whitespace - Giving design whitespace is crucial for easier navigation
3. Limited Color Palatte - strengthens chosen colors and does'nt distract users with too much variety
4. Choice limitation - One of the strong sides of minimalism in interfaces is enhanced user concentration
5. Deep shadows- Huge mistake in design world. But often it can look better, if some lighter blacks is used, to remove use straing and huge contrast.
6. Little Details matter - Designers think they only need to learn how to use colors and pace elements. But everything goes deeper than that.
