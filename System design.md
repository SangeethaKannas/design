I've interviewed hundreds of engineers and written a bestseller on system design interviews. My actionable tips to help you succeed:

1. Ask clarifying questions

We can’t afford to be unfocused. Asking clarifying questions helps us and the interviewer focus on the right things.

From the interviewer’s perspective, not asking clarifying questions is often a no-hire signal.

Here are a few pointers to consider when asking questions. The primary goal of these questions is to eliminate misunderstanding, confusion, and ambiguity.

Use the questions to pin down the functional and non-functional requirements. Use them as a tool to keep the requirements simple and manageable. Leverage them to get a solid idea of the scale and performance constraints.

2. Focus on the core design

There is little time to cover components unrelated to the core design. Skip common components not unique to the problem.

For example, it is not necessary to include a DNS server in the high-level design, nor to discuss the inner workings of a load balancer in the deep dive. Reserve the bandwidth for the core pieces agreed upon during requirement gathering.

Resist the urge to show off our breadth. Don’t get distracted by non-core features.

Focus on demonstrating our ability to deliver a quality design under tight time constraints. Give the interviewers plenty to brag about on our behalf.

3. Don't optimize prematurely

It is a red flag to get carried away early in the session with premature optimizations.

Optimizations are complicated and expensive. They require solid justifications for the added complexity. The added complexity distracts the interviewer and prevents them from understanding the high-level design.

Focus on the task at hand. If you find yourself getting distracted by optimization ideas, table them. Make a list of ideas to revisit in the deep dive section.

4. Tackling deep dive

Deep dive is where we shine. Use this opportunity to demonstrate our ability to identify problems and develop solutions with well-justified trade-offs.

By the time we reach the deep dive section, we should have accumulated a list of potential deep dive topics discovered during high-level design.

From the list, rank the topics by importance. The more critical the issue, the better it is for a deeper dive.

Here are some suggestions on how to tackle each one.

- Clearly articulate why it is a problem and why it is important to solve.

- Propose solutions. In an interview setting, two are usually enough.

- Discuss trade-offs.

- Pick a solution and defend our decision with strong technical reasoning. Engage the interviewer and resolve any disagreement.
