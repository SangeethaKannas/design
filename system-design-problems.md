1. #Client Interface: Develop a User-Friendly mobile application for users to interact with the platform, enabling seamless browsing, searching, and adding items to the cart

2. #application Layer:
👉 API Gateway: Implement an API gateway to handle incoming requests from the client app, manage authentication, and route requests to appropriate services
👉 Catalog Service: Build a service that manages the catalog of items, including product details, images, descriptions, and availability
👉 Pricing Service: Develop a service that retrieves and provides real-time pricing information for the items in the catalog
👉 Search Service: Implement a service that allows users to search and discover items based on various criteria such as keywords, categories, or filters
👉 Cart Service: Create a service responsible for managing the user's shopping cart, handling item addition, removal, and updating quantities

3. #data Layer:
👉 Database: Set up a database to store and retrieve catalog item information, pricing details, user cart data, and any relevant metadata
👉 Caching: Implement a caching layer to enhance performance, store frequently accessed catalog items, and reduce database load

4. #external Integrations:
👉 Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with a payment gateway service to facilitate secure and seamless payment processing
👉 Inventory Management System Integration: Integrate with an inventory management system to synchronize real-time stock availability for the catalog items

5. #infrastructure :
👉 Load Balancer: Employ a load balancer to distribute incoming client requests across multiple instances of the application layer services ensuring scalability and high availability
👉 Containerization/Orchestration: Utilize containerization technologies (e.g. Docker) and orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to simplify deployment, scalability, and management of the application components
👉 Content Delivery Network (CDN): Utilize a CDN to deliver static assets, such as catalog images, to users quickly and efficiently

6. #monitoring and #analytics :
👉 Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring tools to track system performance, identify issues, and proactively resolve them
👉 Analytics: Integrate analytics tools to gain insights into user behavior, engagement, and conversion rates, helping optimize the user experience and business decisions
